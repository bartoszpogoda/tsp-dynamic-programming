# TSP - Dynamic programming

That's my implementation of Held-Karp solution for Traveling Salesman Problem - based on dynamic programming method. Project also contains Full Search solution imported from [previous project](https://github.com/bartoszpogoda/data-struct-and-algorithms-III) mostly for preformance comparison purpose. 

## User Interface

Program serves command line user interface which enables to:
- Generate random instance for given number of cities and solve it,
- Load instance from file
- Run performance tests for hard-coded instance sizes (representative for performance tests)

## File format

First line contains number of cities - N. Next N lines contain N values representing distances between cities.

  
## Documentation

There is a [documentation](https://github.com/bartoszpogoda/tsp-dynamic-programming/blob/master/docs/documentation-pl.pdf) for the project containing problem description, some examples and performance analysis. It is entirely in polish, though.
